üî¥Abstract - The coconut industry faces challenges posed by pest attacks, particularly macaque monkeys, whiteflies, and caterpillars. This research addresses the critical need for effective mitigation strategies by introducing an integrated
system for protecting coconut cultivations from pests. The study focuses on the development and implementation of a solution to detect the presence of macaque monkeys with mechanisms to humanely repel them and predict future incursions, along with
identifying whitefly and caterpillar pest invasions in the early stages to protect the coconut crop. The proposed system offers a
practical solution for safeguarding coconut plantations. By providing early warnings and actionable insights, this research
aims to fortify the coconut industry against the detrimental impact of pests, ensuring the resilience and sustainable
development of coconut cultivation. The findings derived from the implemented methodology for the detection, confirmation,
prediction of macaque monkey behaviors, and identification of minuscule pests exhibit respectively 90%, 97%, 94%, and 98%
accuracy levels.

üî¥Future Work - This paper identified coconut cultivation pests using ANN, CNN, ARIMA, and YOLO models with an overall accuracy between 88% and 99%. The proposed system consists of a mobile application for users to connect with hardware devices. Other than identifying Macaque monkeys, whiteflies, and coconut caterpillars, the mobile application provides predictions regarding future pest attacks. In the future, the system can be expanded by identifying other major pests related to coconut cultivation.
